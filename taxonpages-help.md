# Introduction and Help for TaxonPages
(tag-line option here?)

Welcome to general help for TaxonPages. This document serves to introduce you to the features and design elements found in websites created using 
TaxonPages software, a Companion product to TaxonWorks. Please review the following diagram that illustrates a) where the data are gathered, 
b) where the data get displayed for public access, and c) what software and services make it possible 
to _gather_ and _display_ this information.

## Overview of the TaxonPages User Interface
In the current standard package for TaxonPages software, any TaxonWorks project using TaxonPages code to generate a website gets 3 standard pages.

|standard pages|expected content|customizable<br/>content (yes / no)|
|:-------------------:|----------------------------------------------|:------------:|
|**Home**| offers a **Search-by-taxon** option and information to introduce your visitors and community to your website| yes |
|**TaxonPage**| shows results of any **Search-by-taxon** in default **Panels**| yes |
|**About**| a page designed for you to provide more information of your choosing | yes |

**Home** and **About** pages content (generated in **[markdown](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/lesson/1/)**) can be customized as your group wishes 
and you can make these changes yourself. As a Species File Group **Service** we can help you learn how to do this, after initial setup. 
The **TaxonPage** search results show content in **Panels** each offering distinct data designed to help answer specific questions (e. g. 
What are all the valid names and synonyms for taxa in a given genus? or What are all the literature references for this particular taxon name?). 
Features and functions on this TaxonPage will change as more code is added. Right now, projects can:
- create new pages (beyond Home and About),
- pull data from other soruces to be displayed in the **Contents** Panel (e. g. GBIF, iNat, Plazi, etc).
- develop new Panel sections to be rendered on a Search results page, (e. g. to pull in data from other sources, if desired (e. g. GBIF, iNat, Plazi, etc). 

You can expect more data pulled in from their TaxonWorks Projects in the future.
